# SimpleMSPDoc RC 1.0
I wasn't happy with what other IT documention software had.
I felt they over complicated things and required so much clicky clicky to get to anything.

This idea is ready for use. It is still prett basic/Simple with no plans to make it super crazy.

If you want to try it out:
1. download and put it on your webserver.
2. create a MySql database.
3. configure config.php with the database information
4. navigate your webbrowser to the install.php file
5. follow the steps
6. remove the install.php file for security
7. then use.


Contribute.
If you want to help out in anyway, I welcome your assistance.

This is writting in PHP/MySQL
